Hash Maps
Elements are (key, value) pairs
    Elements are identified by their keys, not values
Access to elements must be effieient
consequently:
    implement an array of elements, so that we can access every element by indexing in O(1) time
    Elements must be indexed by their keys -- not as previously done by their position in the arrays
Different elements with the same index are inserted in a linked list created at that index
consequently: Map is an array of linked lists
    This array is called a table
    Elements of the table
