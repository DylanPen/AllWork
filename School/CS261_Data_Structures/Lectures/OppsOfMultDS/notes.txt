Merge 2 Queues
    Given 2 queues q1 and q2, whose elements are customers
    merge q1 and q2 into a new queue q3
    in O(n) time
    Remove q1 and q2 from memory
    q3 keeps the fifo property of the customers from q1 and q2

    check if q1 and q2 are valid
    initialize q3
    loop simultaniously through q1 and q2 from q1->front and q2->front until the end of the smaller queue
        Pick a customer from q1 or q2 with the smaller arrivla time
        Add that element to q3
    Add the remainder of the larger queue to q3
    Remove q1 and q2 from memory


Difference of bags
    Check is b1 and b2 are valid inputs
    if b1 is not empty
        loop throuhg b2
        read b2->data[i]
        remove from b1 all elements with value equal to b2->data[i]


Convert bag to set (Set is a bag with no repeating elements)
    given a bag as an input
    for each value in bag, keep a single instance and remove all the other duplicates
        initialize an auxiliary set
        copy unique elements from the bag to the set
    return a pointer to the resulting set
    all the functions of bags and dynamic arrays are available
