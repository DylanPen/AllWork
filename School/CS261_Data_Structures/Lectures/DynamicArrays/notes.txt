Static Arrays:
    Pros:
    - Simple
    - Each element is accessable in 0(1)
    Cons:
    - Memory capacity must be fixed when created
    - No easy way to later request for more Memory

Doubling capacity:
    1: Memorze old data pointer
    2: allocate a new, larger space
    3: copy data elements to the new space
    4: Free old space

Malloc:
    - malloc() is a functon which dynamically allocates a block of memory (on the heap)

Free:
    - The argument free() can ONLY be a pointer
        free(da->data);
    - this pointer must be allocated with malloc()
    - Suppose we declare:
        TYPE data[10], x;
        WRONG:
            free(data);
            free(data[i]);
            free(&x);
