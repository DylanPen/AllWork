 * Description: Allocates a dynamic array of baseball player structs

 * Returns (baseball_player*): Pointer to base address of dynamically
 * 		allocated array
 * Pre-conditions: size is initialized with an int greater than 0
 * Post-conditions: Dynamic array of baseball players allocated. The
 * 		responsibility of freeing this array's memory falls to the function
 * 		caller.

 * 		data (ifstream objects must be passed by reference). The

 * 		player's information (i.e., the next stream extraction operator

 * Returns: A baseball_player structure containing the information of the data
